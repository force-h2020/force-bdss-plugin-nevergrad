The ``force-nevergrad`` plugin
******************************

The `force-bdss-plugin-nevergrad  <https://github.com/force-h2020/force-bdss-plugin-nevergrad>`_ contributes a wrapper
around the gradient-free optimization library `nevergrad <https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad>`_.
The wrapper consists of two parts:

#. The optimization engine ``NevergradOptimizerEngine``, which is used as a backend tool
   for worklow optimization.
   The engine inherits from the ``BaseOptimizerEngine`` class.
   It provides a public ``optimize()`` method that  yields workflow input data and output results, and any additional
   metadata generated by the engine.
#. The basic multi-criteria optimizer ``NevergradMCO(BaseMCO)``. The ``MCO`` class configures the ``NevergradOptimizerEngine``
   instance, and executes the optimizer.
   The standard progress events ``MCOProgressEvent`` are generated during the optimization, containing the optimal points and
   optimal KPIs.

Users can perform the gradient-free optimization of their workflows by specifying the ``nevergrad_mco`` as the MCO model id:

.. code-block:: json

    "workflow": {
        "mco_model": {
            "id": "force.bdss.nevergrad.plugin.wrapper.v0.factory.nevergrad_mco",
            "model_data": {
                "algorithms": "OnePlusOne",
                "budget": 200,
                "verbose_run": true
            }
        }
    }


Users can import the ``NevergradOptimizerEngine`` and implement their own family of ``MCOFactory, MCOModel, MCO`` classes
that use the ``nevergrad`` as the optimizer engine.
